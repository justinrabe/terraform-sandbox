Terraform project. I'm using this project in order to learn more about Cloud Infrastructure and applying my knowledge from working on the AWS Cloud Practitioner. 

Currently, I''m aiming to provision a set of Windows EC2 instances and creating the instances with SQL Server installed. I'll need to configure these instances with a Powershell script in order to accomplish this.
